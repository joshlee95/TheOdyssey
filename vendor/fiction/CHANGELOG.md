# Changelog

All notable changes to the Fiction plugin will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Mannered prose rule** — Guidance against the figure of speech that stands in for a plain statement:
  - New prose smell #10, *The Mannered Metaphor*, in `references/prose-smells.md`: why a live metaphor earns its place and a mannered one does not, the test to apply, and the fix
  - New *Mannered Prose* anti-pattern in `references/prose-style.md`, distinguished from purple prose, pointing at the catalogue entry
  - Row added to the Prose Mistakes table in `references/anti-patterns.md`
- **Style guide integration** — Comprehensive support for The Chicago Manual of Style (American) and the New Oxford Style Manual (British) in the editing pipeline:
  - Four new reference files in `references/style-guides/`: `shared-rules.md` (common rules), `chicago-manual.md` (CMOS), `oxford-style-manual.md` (NOSM), and `decision-matrix.md` (side-by-side comparison)
  - Covers spelling, punctuation (dash style, quotation marks, comma/period placement, serial comma, ellipsis), number rendering, capitalisation, date formats, and vocabulary
  - Editor agent loads the appropriate guide based on the project's declared style in `craft/tone.md`, or detects from context
  - Cross-cultural manuscript support: narrative follows project guide, dialogue follows character voice
  - Updated `craft/tone.md` template (both standalone and series) with Language & Style section
  - Updated architect agent output format to include Language & Style decisions
  - Updated new-project wizard to ask about style guide during Phase 1 Discovery
  - Editor memory now tracks style guide, dash style, quote placement convention, and spelling variant
  - Style guide references added to 8 agents: editor, writer, chapter-reviewer, voice-analyzer, critique, continuity, language-checker, architect
  - Style guide references added to fiction skill craft reference table, reconcile skill audit checklist, go skill, and language skill
  - All 4 style guide files cross-reference each other and list consuming agents
  - Reconcile skill now audits for Language & Style section in `craft/tone.md`
- **Review coordinator agent** — New `review-coordinator` agent that prevents context overflow when reviewing large manuscripts:
  - Spawns parallel chapter-reviewer agents in its own context window, writes results to `review-report.md`
  - Returns only aggregate summary (verdicts, issue counts, cross-chapter patterns) to the parent
  - Built-in caching: checks report freshness against chapter file timestamps, skips re-reviewing if nothing changed
  - Batches reviewers in groups of 10 for manuscripts with 25+ chapters
  - Updated `review` skill to route multi-chapter reviews (`all`, ranges) through coordinator while keeping single-chapter reviews fast

## [1.10.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added

- **Manuscript digest layer** — New `reader-digest` coordinator agent that prevents context overflow when reading large manuscripts:
  - Spawns parallel reader agents in its own context window, writes results to `manuscript-digest.md`
  - Returns only a short summary to the parent agent — no more context blowouts on 15+ chapter books
  - Built-in caching: checks digest freshness against chapter file timestamps, skips re-reading if nothing changed
  - Supports both `skim` and `careful` modes
  - Updated 5 consuming agents to use digest: **synopsis**, **critique**, **continuity**, **voice-analyzer**, and the **go** skill
- **Persistent agent memory** — 4 agents now build knowledge across sessions using `memory: project`:
  - **continuity** — Maintains a running fact database (character details, timeline, geography, objects). Future checks compare against known facts instead of re-reading the entire manuscript.
  - **editor** — Builds a style profile (language variant, crutch word frequencies, formatting conventions, author override decisions). Eliminates re-discovery of conventions each session.
  - **writer** — Remembers voice decisions (tense, POV, narrative distance), character speech patterns, and vocabulary choices. Maintains consistency across writing sessions.
  - **chapter-reviewer** — Tracks review history so feedback evolves (doesn't re-flag resolved issues, escalates persistent ones). Remembers author preferences and voice baseline.
- **`permissionMode: acceptEdits`** — 5 file-writing agents now skip per-write permission prompts:
  - writer, editor, chapter-reviewer, critique, synopsis

### Technical Notes

- Memory is stored in `.claude/agent-memory/<agent-name>/` within the fiction project
- Each agent's MEMORY.md has a size cap (80-150 lines) with compression rules to stay under the 200-line auto-load limit
- All memory sections include a staleness rule: the manuscript text is always more authoritative than memory
- Memory was deliberately NOT added to: ephemeral agents (reader-skim, reader-careful), critic personas (james-wood, stephen-king, etc.), or wizard agents (architect, outliner) whose output already IS the project's memory

## [1.9.0] - 2026-01-25

### Changed

- **Migrated all commands to skills directory** — Following Claude Code's merge of commands into skills. All 17 commands now live in `skills/` as individual directories with SKILL.md files.
- **Shared references moved** — Reference files now at `skills/references/` (accessible to all skills)
- **Removed commands directory** — No longer needed; `plugin.json` updated accordingly

### Added

- **`context: fork` for wizard skills** — `/new`, `/plan`, `/character`, `/outline` now run in isolated subagents for cleaner multi-turn conversations
- **`disable-model-invocation` for utility skills** — `/build`, `/notes`, `/reconcile` won't auto-invoke
- **Dynamic context injection** — `/go` and `/build` skills use `!`command`` syntax to inject project state
- **`argument-hint` frontmatter** — Improved autocomplete hints for skills with arguments

### Migration Notes

If you have custom commands in your project's `.claude/commands/`, they continue to work. Skills take precedence if both exist with the same name.
