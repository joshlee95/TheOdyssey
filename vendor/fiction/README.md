# Fiction Writing Plugin for Claude Code and Codex

Write complete novels with Claude or Codex. Literary prose, iterative review, and craft-aware feedback.

## What This Is

A complete fiction writing system—from initial concept through final draft. Specialized agents handle different aspects of the craft: architecture, characters, prose, review, editing, continuity, and publishing prep.

This isn't a chatbot that writes generic content. It's a writing partner that understands story structure, character arcs, scene economy, and the difference between good prose and great prose.

## Installation

```bash
claude plugins:add howells/fiction
```

Fiction also includes `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` for native Codex plugin hosts.

## Quick Start

### New Project

```bash
/fiction:plan        # Design your story's architecture
/fiction:character   # Develop your protagonist
/fiction:outline     # Break into chapters
"Write chapter 1"    # Start writing
```

### Existing Project

```bash
/fiction:go          # Load project and see what to work on next
```

```

## Recommended Workflow

Fiction writing isn't linear—it's iterative. Here's how to use the plugin effectively:

### Phase 1: Foundation

Start with `/fiction:new` for a guided project setup, or build manually:

```bash
/fiction:plan          # Define premise, theme, ending, tone
/fiction:character     # Develop protagonist and key characters
/fiction:outline       # Break into chapters with scene beats
```

**Don't skip this.** A weak foundation creates problems that compound with every chapter. Know your ending before you start writing.

### Phase 2: First Draft

Write chapters one at a time. After each chapter:

```bash
"Write chapter 3"      # Write the chapter
/fiction:review        # Get craft-focused feedback
# Revise based on feedback
/fiction:review        # Review again if needed
```

The review → revise → review loop is where the real work happens. Don't move on until a chapter is solid.

### Phase 3: Polish

Once all chapters are drafted:

```bash
/fiction:edit          # Line-level editing (all chapters)
/fiction:review        # Re-review after edits
```

The editor catches spelling, grammar, word echoes, and awkward phrasing. Review again afterward—editing can introduce new issues.

### Phase 4: Manuscript Review

When the full draft is complete:

```bash
/fiction:critique      # Full manuscript critique (NYT/New Yorker style)
```

This is a comprehensive review of the entire work: structure, character arcs, themes, pacing, prose quality. Use it to identify what needs revision before calling the manuscript done.

### Phase 5: Publishing Prep

When the manuscript is final:

```bash
/fiction:synopsis      # Generate query letter synopses
/fiction:naming        # Find the right title
/fiction:cover         # Generate cover art prompts
/fiction:build         # Export to EPUB
```

### The Short Version

```
/fiction:new or /fiction:plan
         ↓
    Foundation work (characters, outline)
         ↓
┌──→ Write chapter
│        ↓
│    /fiction:review
│        ↓
└─── Revise (loop until solid)
         ↓
    /fiction:edit (all chapters)
         ↓
    /fiction:critique (full manuscript)
         ↓
    Publishing prep (synopsis, naming, cover, build)
```

### Returning to a Project

```bash
/fiction:go            # Load project and get recommendation for what to do next
```

## Core Principles

The plugin enforces these craft principles:

1. **Story = Character + Change** — Plot is what happens; story is what it means
2. **Scene Economy** — Every scene must do at least two things
3. **Specificity Creates Universality** — Concrete details create resonance
4. **Earned Moments** — Plant before harvest
5. **Trust the Reader** — Show, don't tell. Imply, don't explain
6. **Write for the Ear** — Modern books become audiobooks

## Anchored Constraints

Mark immutable decisions with `## ⚓ Anchored` in any document. Review agents treat these as non-negotiable.

```markdown
## ⚓ Anchored

- The protagonist never learns the truth about her father
- The ending is ambiguous
- No magic system explanations; it stays mysterious
```

## Craft References

23 craft and style reference documents guide the writing and review process:

| Problem             | Reference              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Story feels aimless | `story-structure.md`   |
| Scene drags         | `scene-structure.md`   |
| Flat characters     | `character.md`         |
| Stilted dialogue    | `dialogue.md`          |
| Prose lacks rhythm  | `prose-style.md`       |
| Pacing issues       | `pacing.md`            |
| Weak opening        | `openings.md`          |

| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------- |
| Synopsis generation    | reader-skim / reader-careful | ~3-4×   |
